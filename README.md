# -Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-MNIST-
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, a standard benchmark in the field of computer vision and deep learning. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and achieves high accuracy in classifying digits from 0 to 9.

📌 Problem Statement:
</br>
Handwritten text can vary significantly in style, making it challenging to interpret. This project demonstrates how AI can help recognize handwritten digits, which has practical applications in edtech, smart exam-checking tools, and form digitization.

🎯 Objective:

Build and train a CNN model that accurately classifies handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using deep learning techniques.

✅ Features:
</br>
✅ Load MNIST dataset using keras.datasets.</br>
✅ Preprocess and normalize the data.</br>
✅ Build and train a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras.</br>
✅ Evaluate model accuracy and performance.</br>
✅ Achieves over 98% accuracy/</br>

🖌️ (Optional) Build a simple UI to draw digits and see real-time predictions
